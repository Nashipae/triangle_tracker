# Triangle Tracker
#### Triangle Tracker web application that checks on type of triangles formed from different lengths., {29-Mar-2019}
#### By **Naomi Wariara**
## Description
The triangle tracker is a web-based platform that helps users determine the kind of triangle they get using different lengths. Upon submitting their triangle lengths, the users are advised on the kind of triangle their measurements make. This assists the users make quick decisions in their design work.
## Setup/Installation Requirements
* For it to work, the user should key in the length1, length 2 and length3 parameters of the triangle in the form provided. Secondly, the user should click the 'Submit' button so as to get feedback on the kind of triangle formed from the lengths. 
* To understand how the project works, the project behavior works as follows:
* For equilateral triangle, all sides must be equal.
* For isosceles triangle, two sides are exactly equal and the sum of any two sides of the triangle is greater than the length of third remaining side.
* For scalene triangle, none of the sides is equal and the sum of any two sides of the triangle is greater than the length of third remaining side.
* If the sum of any two sides of the triangle is equal to or less than the third remaining side, then a triangle CANNOT be formed using those values.

## Known Bugs
The form output element may not work well in Edge 12 or Internet Explorer and earlier versions.
## Technologies Used
The Triangle Tracker web application uses Javascript, CSS and HTML languages.
